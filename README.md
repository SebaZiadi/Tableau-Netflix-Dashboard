# Netflix  Dashboard
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the Netflix dataset. The goal is to create a series of insightful visualizations and interactive dashboards in Tableau to uncover key trends and 
business opportunities.

The analysis focuses on exploring sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior across various dimensions such as regions, product categories, and time.

# Dataset
The analysis is built upon the well-known Superstore dataset, which includes detailed records of:

- Sales and Profit: Transaction-level data for sales, profit, and discount.

- Customer Information: Details on customer name, segment, and region.

- Product Information: Data on product category, sub-category, and item names.

- Geographical Data: Sales performance by country, state, and city.

# Key Features and Analysis
The final dashboard provides a holistic view of the business, with a focus on answering critical questions, including:

- Overall Performance: What are the total sales and profit, and how have they trended over time?

- Geographic Insights: Which regions and cities are the most profitable, and which require attention?

- Product Analysis: What are the best-selling and most profitable product categories and sub-categories?

- Customer Segmentation: How do different customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) contribute to sales and profit?

- Dashboard Interactivity: The visualizations are interconnected, allowing users to filter data and gain deeper insights with a single click.

# Technology Stack
- Tableau Desktop: The primary tool used for data visualization and dashboard creation.

- Tableau Public: Used for hosting and sharing the final interactive dashboard.
